# LinkedIn Profile Viewers Viewer

Userscript that allows you to see who recently viewed your profile without buying premium - tested and used on [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), but should work with any userscript manager

Side note, if nothing shows up then try reloading the `/me/profile-views` page until it works lol
